## Datasets and sources
The first dataset was created by Gavin Abercrombie, and pulled from the following [link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fn2mmff85g/1). The tweets in this dataset were received having been manually scored based on the context of the tweet in the string of replies from user 1 to user 2. Only the Author tweets were used in this analysis, and were pulled using Tweepy and the Twitter API. Approximately 600 of the original tweets were no longer available. This dataset accounts for 1580 tweets  or ~20% of the Tweets used in this analysis.

The second dataset was created from self-labeled tweets labeled with the hashtag "sarcasm" or "sarcastic" and including a user tag indicating the tweet belongs to a larger conversation. This dataset comes from the following [repository](https://github.com/EducationalTestingService/sarcasm) and accounts for ~80% of the Tweets used in this analysis.
